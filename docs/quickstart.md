# Quickstart

The best way to quickly understand what CompGenerator does and how to use it is to walk through an example. This document shows how to use CompGenerator to produce scorecards and badges for a small sample competition.

To do: write this. Cover setting up your files, editing your config and assignments, running CompGenerator, and viewing results. Follow the Running steps in installation_and_running.md. Show a flow that doesn't rely on any other WCA tools (i.e. start with CSV from WCA website export)
